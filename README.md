# Mud
Before my son was born I wanted to find a way to help him learn to program so I started this project back in late 2016.  Since then my daughter has been born and I hope to also use this to teach her program.  

Over the course of many lunch breaks and a few sleepless morning I've developed a working Mud based upon my memories of the ones I played in college.  I've migrated my code base over to GitHub so more people could have access to it instead of being limited to 5 in TFS.
